This folder of Java classes focus on the first two requirements mentioned in the quetion about LinkQueueApp, as follow:
• Put different classes in separate files.
• Create a new remove() method that removes item N after N calls to the method

I want to split them with the folder about simulating a queue of customers in order not to get any undesired error. 
I'm sorry for this inconvenience lecturer :<
