This folder of Java classes focus on the next two requirements mentioned in the quetion about LinkQueueApp, as follow:
• Simulate a queue of customers each one served for a random amount of time.
• Add a size() method and investigate how simulation is affected by the time needed to serve a 
  customer and the rate at which customers join the queue.

I want to split them with the first folder in order not to get any undesired error. 
I'm sorry for this inconvenience, lecturer :<
